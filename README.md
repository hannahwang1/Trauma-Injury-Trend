# Trauma Injury Trend Analysis

The purpose of this data project was to is to understand and analyze the patterns and trends in trauma injury data over time. This could help Division of Trauma to identify and address the underlying causes of trauma injuries, and to develop strategies for preventing or mitigating the negative impacts of these injuries. In order to help to focus prevention and management efforts on these high-risk groups, analysis was conducted to identify groups of people who are at particularly high risk of experiencing trauma injuries. Additionally, the data project aimed to examine patterns and trends in the mechanisms of injuries that are being sustained, as well as in the outcomes of these injuries. Findings would be used to improve treatment and rehabilitation strategies, with the goal of reducing the negative impacts of trauma injuries on individuals and communities.

## Project Summary

•	I used Python to perform EDA and data cleaning on the dataset, which helped me understand the structure and patterns within the data.

•	To visualize the geographic data (injury zip code) in the dataset, I used Tableau to create interactive maps to demonstrate the geographic distribution of injury cases. This allowed me to explore and communicate the spatial patterns and trends in the data. 

•	Time series analysis was conducted to understand the temporal trend of trauma injury patients admitted.

•	Built linear models to explain the association between the prevalence of trauma injury and neighborhood demographic factors and made recommendations for trauma-informed care.
